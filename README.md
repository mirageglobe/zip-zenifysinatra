ZenifySinatra is designed to make the life of developers easier. It's built using HTML5 with responsive bootstrap (with bootstrap normalise included). It was updated using some of the HTML5 Boilerplate's recommended markup and setup. It now includes fontawesome, bootstrap, jquery by default. It has a carousel which you can disable. It is based using ruby and designed for heroku.

# Features #

- Includes Bootstrap 3.2.0 via Bootswatch 3.2.0.1 (via CDN)
- Includes FontAwesome 4.2.0 (via CDN)
- Includes Jquery 2.1.1 (via CDN)
- Mobile Responsive (First)
- Built with Sinatra - Puma / HAML

# To use #

  $ foreman start

# Guidelines #

a few points to note before submitting PR :

- minimal number of files (settings etc)
- use CDN (Content Delivery network) when possible to reduce hosted repos
- mobile responsive enabling
- follow bootstrap guidelines
- simple and clean UX/UI (Try to; although this is subjective; rule of thumb is if something is not essential, remove it)

# Roadmap #

- add sample vuejs / nuxt
- add erb sample
- [done] update theme with erb / haml
